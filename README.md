# Running optimization
- To run AR coating GA optimization of widths and refractive indecies of layers with respect to wavelengths run 'project_2d.xpl' in plaskgui
- If you want to optimize higher number of layers adjust N_LAYERS and add Rectangle called "layerx" where x is the next natural layer number

# Plotting reflectivity of optimized structure with respect to angles
- To plot reflectivity with respect to angles run "project_3d.xpl"
- Proivde optimed params from the previous GA run in d_star and n_star
- Strandard mean reflectivity can be obtained by running "project_3d_standrd_mean.xpl" the same way as "project_3d.xpl"
